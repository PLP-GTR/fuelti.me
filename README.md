# todo's / notes

- Add picture uploads for receipes and vehicles (stations?)
- Add categories or tags, so fuel logs can be differentiated between private/work/travel/commute (user defined)
- Add export / sync with other applications which support import or sync to google drive (i.e. Fuelio)
- Support not only distances but usage hours (renaming distance to utilization)
