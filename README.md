## bugs

- store currency code with fueling instead of foreign key? if currency should be deleted. but no, maybe flag currency as inactive? or just leave them as is and make sure that foreign keys prevent deletion

## features

- Read
- Store
- Routing
- Views
- Seeders
- api
- add user base currency
- store exchange rate to user's base currency at time of fueling to fueling
- Support not only distances but usage hours (renaming distance to utilization)
- Support types of cars to switch themes and display other, more important information i.e. "Daily Driver" (blueish design; km driven, consumption, costs/km & overall), "Commute only" (economy design, costs/month), "Racecar" (red/black design; costs)
- Add picture uploads for receipes and vehicles (stations?)
- Add categories or tags, so fuel logs can be differentiated between private/work/travel/commute (user defined)
- Add export / sync with other applications which support import or sync to google drive (i.e. Fuelio)
- Add support to choose car from dropdown via internet database (also model code / VIN)
- Add support for multi-fuel/flex engines, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexible-fuel_vehicle or https://www.cargas.de/car-gas/produkte/prins-vsi-dieselblend-20/, they combine for instance diesel and LPG/CNG
- Add support for different EV charging methods, since they differ in costs and are using the same tank (just like flex fuel cars)
