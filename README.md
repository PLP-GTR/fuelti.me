Gas/Fuel consumption tracker

# todo's, notes and ideas

- table for tanks (id, fuel_type_uuid, capacity, capacity_unit_uuid, flag if standard)
- table for places (i.e. gas stations, at home like farmes refuel etc)
- table for fuel_types
- Support not only distances but usage hours (renaming distance to utilization)
- Support types of cars to switch themes and display other, more important information i.e. "Daily Driver" (blueish design; km driven, consumption, costs/km & overall), "Commute only" (economy design, costs/month), "Racecar" (red/black design; costs)
- Add picture uploads for receipes and vehicles (stations?)
- Add categories or tags, so fuel logs can be differentiated between private/work/travel/commute (user defined)
- Add export / sync with other applications which support import or sync to google drive (i.e. Fuelio)
- Add support to choose car from dropdown via internet database (also model code / VIN)
